# etch-a-sketch
Third project of The Odin Project Curriculum. Building browser version of etch-a-sketch game. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Similarly to second project made use of and deepened knowledge of:
 - Functions
 - DOM manipulation
 - EventListeners
 - Gridbox

I think code is still messy and it could be better, but at least it works :) Might update in the future
